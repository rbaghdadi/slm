  abstract = {We present the design and implementation of an automatic polyhedral
	source-to-source transformation framework that can optimize regular
	programs (sequences of possibly imperfectly nested loops) for parallelism
	and locality simultaneously. Through this work, we show the practicality
	of analytical model-driven automatic transformation in the polyhedral
	model -- far beyond what is possible by current production compilers.
	Unlike previous works, our approach is an end-to-end fully automatic
	one driven by an integer linear optimization framework that takes
	an explicit view of finding good ways of tiling for parallelism and
	locality using affine transformations. The framework has been implemented
	into a tool to automatically generate {OpenMP} parallel code from
	C program sections. Experimental results from the tool show very
	high speedups for local and parallel execution on multi-cores over
	state-of-the-art compiler frameworks from the research community
	as well as the best native production compilers. The system also
	enables the easy use of powerful empirical/iterative optimization
	for general arbitrarily nested loop sequences.},
